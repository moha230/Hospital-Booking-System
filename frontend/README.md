#  React Component Structure Notes

##  Structure Philosophy: Feature-Based (Page-Based)

In this project, components are organized **by page or feature**, instead of keeping all components in one global `components/` folder. This makes the codebase more scalable, modular, and easier to understand.



##  Reasons for using Feature-Based?

- Keeps all files related to a specific page (component, styles, logic) in one place.
- Easier to manage and debug â€” especially in larger applications.
- Improves team collaboration by reducing code collisions.
- Encourages modular design.
